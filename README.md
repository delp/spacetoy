Experimenting with golang Pixel library to create a Solar Jetman type game

This experiment is based on the very excellent example [go-jetpack](https://github.com/faiface/pixel-examples/tree/master/community/go-jetpack) by [Branson Camp](https://github.com/bcamp1) using [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel)
